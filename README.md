# Algorithm-Viz

Algorithim Visualization using [OneLoneCode Pixel Game Engine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine). 

Currently working on visualizations for:
  - Sorting Algorithms

Next Steps:
  - Graph Algorithms (Minimum Spanning Trees, Shortest Path)
  - Maze Algorithms

<sup>Seems like every CS student has at some point done this project ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</sup>
